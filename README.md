# 🍳 Smart Recipe Generator

An AI-assisted cooking application that helps users discover recipes based on available ingredients, dietary preferences, and cooking constraints — all running locally with a clean web UI.

---

## 📌 Overview

**Smart Recipe Generator** allows users to:
- Input ingredients manually
- Select ingredients from categorized dropdowns
- Upload food images for ingredient detection

The system matches ingredients against a curated recipe dataset and ranks recipes by relevance.

This project focuses on **core logic**, **UI usability**, and **extensibility**, without relying on paid or third-party AI services.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Then open:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

📦 Python Dependencies Installed

For local image recognition, the following Python libraries were installed using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow numpy
```

🧪 How Recipe Matching Works

User ingredients are normalized

Recipes are scored by ingredient overlap

Filters are applied (diet, difficulty, time)

Recipes are ranked by match percentage

Top results are displayed instantly

🐍 Python & Vision Integration

This project does not rely on paid APIs or third-party AI services.
Instead, it uses a local Python-based vision pipeline.

🔍 Image Recognition Flow

Images uploaded in the UI are sent to the Node.js server

Node.js invokes a Python script (recognize.py)

A pretrained ImageNet-based CNN model is used

Predicted labels are mapped to food ingredients using:

imagenet_classes.txt

Curated ingredient lists in JavaScript

📦 Python Libraries Used

torch

torchvision

Pillow

numpy

These libraries are used to:

Load a pretrained vision model

Run image inference locally

Convert predictions into usable ingredient names

⚠️ Python setup is optional — the app works fully without image recognition.

🧠 Ingredient Mapping Strategy

Raw ImageNet labels are not used directly

Labels are matched against:

KNOWN_INGREDIENTS

Category-based ingredient lists

This avoids noisy outputs (e.g. non-food objects)

Only food-relevant ingredients are extracted

✅ Why This Architecture?

❌ No Hugging Face

❌ No Google Vision

❌ No paid APIs

✅ Fully local

✅ Deterministic & reliable

✅ Ideal for demos, assessments, and offline use

### 🛠 Extensibility

This project is intentionally designed to be extended:
- Plug in a real image recognition API
- Add more recipe datasets
- Enhance the UI with React or Vue
- Add user accounts and cloud storage

---

### 📄 Notes

- No paid APIs required
- No external AI dependency
- Fully functional offline logic
- Suitable for assessments and demos
